# Git for Scientists

A guide to writing research papers with Markdown, Git, and Claude — no command line needed.

## What is this?

A getting-started guide for researchers who want version control but refuse to use the terminal. You tell Claude what you want in plain English; it handles the Git commands for you.

The guide covers:

- **Why Markdown + Git** — and how they compare to Word and Dropbox
- **Setting up a project** — repository, folder structure, `.gitignore`
- **The core workflow** — write, review the diff, commit, repeat
- **Using Claude's three modes** — Chat for thinking, Cowork for drafting, Code for managing
- **Safety nets** — undo, restore, branches for safe experimentation
- **Collaboration** — GitHub, push/pull, resolving conflicts with co-authors
- **Submission** — converting Markdown to Word/PDF, citations, tagging milestones, handling reviewer revisions

## Who is this for?

Researchers with zero Git or command-line experience who write papers and want to stop losing work, collaborate better, and use AI tools responsibly.
